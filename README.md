# ModularLöve for LÖVE

A port of [Modular Play](https://orllewin.github.io/playdate/modular_play/) to [LÖVE (Love2D)](https://love2d.org/). This isn't really ready for use, the happy path for basic use is fine but everything else is broken.

## Contributing

PRs are welcome. Please fix my bad Lua code.

## Todo

* Everything.
* Add noise module from [Noise](https://github.com/orllewin/love2d_noise).
* Cables can be added to places they shouldn't.
* You can't delete a module.
* There's no patch load/save
* The object class is from Playdate which is copyrighted by Panic, need to replace with an alternative implementation.
